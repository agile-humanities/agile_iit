# Agile IIT
## Introduction

A Drupal 7 wrapper for the IIT Image Comparison Tool.

## Requirements

* [Flag](https://www.drupal.org/project/flag)
* [Views](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)

## Installation

Install as usual, see [this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for further information.

## Usage

Installing this module will automatically create the "Selected" flag (selected_images), and users who have permission to 
use this flag (by default, all authenticated users) will see a link to "My Selected Images" on the Navigation menu. This
link leads to "/selected" which is a menu path defined in a view.
